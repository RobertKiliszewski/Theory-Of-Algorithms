# Theory-Of-Algorithms

Lecturer : Dr.Ian McLoughlin

Programming Language : Racket

An introduction to the theory of algorithms, especially the areas of computation and computability.
Students will also learn practical skills in the development of software using a selection of programming paradigms. 
The module, like all other modules at GMIT, is described in a module descriptor that lists the learning outcomes that the student must meet
to pass the module, and the breakdown of assessments in the module.

This repositroy will contain the solutions to the Theory of Algorithms problems that are set out during the college semester.

The purpose of this is to gain a bigger understanding of problem solving.

### Learning Outcomes: 
* Compare different models of computation.
* Write computer programs using a selection of programming paradigms.
* Analyse the complexity of an algorithm.
* Identify difficult computational problems in everyday programming.

### Allowed Functions
* cons
* car
* cdr
* define
* lambda
* if
* null
* null?
* cond
* map
* equals (=)
* plus (+)
* minus (-)
* multiply (*) 
* divide (/)
* modulo
